At the end of 2019 and grossly picking up momentum in 2020, the world is currently facing a global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of May 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 4M people worldwide now claiming over 250K lives.

  Is this pandemic impacting nations indiscriminately or are there emerging trends & patterns that can be observed?

  The virus impacts individuals with pre-existing conditions, but how is it affecting whole regions/nations?

  Are there specific correlations between mortality rates and factors such as health expenditure, number of hospital beds and   GNI?
